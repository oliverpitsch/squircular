</ul>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The following examples, on how not to use icons purchased under this license, are based on frequently asked questions from other users.</p>

<h3 id="you-may-not-resell-the-icons">You may not resell the icons</h3>

<p>When you buy an icon, you gain the rights to use it in commercial and non-commercial projects. You can use it for your own or your client's website, app, presentation etc. However, this license does not give your the rights to resell the icons as a product. You cannot download icons and put them up on your own site for sale.</p>

<h3 id="icons-cannot-be-resold-as-part-of-mass-distributed-digital-products">Icons cannot be resold as part of mass distributed digital products</h3>

<p>When you buy an icon, you gain the rights to use it in commercial and non-commercial projects. You can use it for your own or your client's website, app, presentation etc. You are, for example, free to use the icons in a SaaS analytics dashboard product you sell to customers. But, you cannot use the icons in a dashboard Bootstrap UI theme, you sell on a theme marketplace. this license does not give you the rights to resell the icons as part of digital products like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Themes</li>
  <li>UI-kits</li>
  <li>Software frameworks</li>
  <li>In-app purchase icon packs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="icons-cannot-be-used-on-merchandise-for-sale">Icons cannot be used on merchandise for sale</h3>

<p>Using icons on T-shirts and other types of physical products is fine, but reselling these products is not permitted. You can print an icon on a T-shirt for your self, a client or for internal use in your company. But you are not allowed to print an icon on a shirt and then resell the shirt as a product. The reason is that as soon as the icon becomes the main motif on the shirt, cup or whatever item you had in mind, it goes from being an icon to being a new product in itself.</p>

<h3 id="the-icons-cannot-be-used-as-logos">The icons cannot be used as logos</h3>

<p>In many ways icons are like logos. The artwork is simple and elegant, and often has a very clear and easy to understand meaning. This license does not permit the icons to be used as logos. Your logo has to be unique, otherwise it cannot be trademarked. Also, if you try to trademark a logo that is an icon, the designer of the icon can have a conflicting copyright ownership. I therefore do not allow the usage of the Licensed material as logos.</p>
